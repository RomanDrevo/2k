/*
this is the example response for a successful finish of the create new hosted site funnel.
for creating the UI, the funnel can be skipped for now by sendin a POST/hosted request, then cutting straight to receiving the full hosted obj as appears in this
GET/hosted response.

in reality, when sending the POST/hosted request, there will be returned a mostly empty object (as you can see from the post-hosted-response.json in this dir
that's because we send the duplicator request async, and only after polling the client will be able to determine that the duplication has finished,
when pollion with a GET/hosted request like this returns the is_duplication_ready=True, then you can trust the other fields like thumbnail_url (to show in the create/edit campaign funnel) and the url of the duplicated site itself.

this is the response for GET/hosted with param hosted_id=20
